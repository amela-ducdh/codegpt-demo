The code has a few issues. 

Firstly, it is missing the require statement for the 'mysql' module. 
Secondly, it is using string interpolation to pass in user-provided values as a parameter in the query, which can lead to SQL injection attacks. 
To fix this, we should use prepared statements instead of string interpolation. 
Finally, there is no error handling for the query function. 
We should add an error handler to handle any errors that may occur when executing the query. 

Fixed code: 

```js

const mysql = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'test'
});
// Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks 
 const query = SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?; 
 connection.query(query, [req.body.username], (err, result) => { 
   if (err) { 
     // Handle the error 
   } else { 
     // Do something with the result 
     console.log(result); 
   } 
 });
 
 ```
